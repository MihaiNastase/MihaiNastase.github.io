							Following an induction for each project the ADM students decided to go with the Abiotic and Biotic roof garden project, this project was coordinated by their tutor Eccles Ng. 
							Those students studying BA Landscape, BA Architecture and MA Architecture were the ones who could apply for this CoLab project as it suited their title best.</p>
