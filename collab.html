							<h2>The ADM department</h2>
							<p class="gr">As part of their CoLab module our colleagues studying at the Faculty of Arts, Design and Media were introduced six different projects, from which they had to pick one, this would have been the one they found the most interesting and wanted to develop further skills in. 
							Following an induction for each project the ADM students decided to go with the Abiotic and Biotic roof garden project, this project was coordinated by their tutor Eccles Ng. 
							Those students studying BA Landscape, BA Architecture and MA Architecture were the ones who could apply for this CoLab project as it suited their title best.</p>
							<p class="gr">The project of choice was Abiotic and Biotic roof garden, which meant that they wiould be looking into the non-living and living parts of the environment, for example non living factors would be the climate, landform, temperature, water, soil storms etc. 
							Whereas the living factors are plants, animals, micro organisms etc.
							As they describe it: "<i>So, the task we have been given as students is to design a roof garden which can be used by all individuals like designers and constructors, this needs to be a roof garden which can be a multi useable space, in other words a space which can be used to sit down, stand, lie down and eat it. 
							While creating this space we need to also be able to consider other factors such as:
							<ul>
							<li>The social and engagement opportunities for students, designers, contractors, consumers and wider public</li>
							<li>An inspirational workspace for design professionals</li>
							<li>An opportunity to show case and display products</li>
							<li>Local environment and ecology</li>
							<li>Green and blue system</li>
							<li>Marketing and branding</li>
							<li>Input solution on technical constraints</li>
							<li>Liaising and aligning with client’s vision</li>
							</ul>
							This will all take place in Marshall’s Design Space in Birmingham as they are our client."</i></p>
							<h2>The Company: Marshalls</h2>
							<p class="gr">Marshalls is one of the leading natural stone paving providers since 1890, the company has an impressive portfolio of completed projects across the UK. 
							When designing their products they always think of ways of making sure they could provide very high standards of materials for their client and try to persuade their clients to use their products as they always 
							try to take into consideration ways in which they could keep the environment as sustainable as possible because they strongly believe even if this doesn’t affect us today, we need to think about the tomorrow.</p>
							<img src="Img/marshalls-logo.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Marshalls Logo">
							<p class="gr">Therefore, the reasons why they continue to achieve very high standards of work is because they have a very wide range of over 2000 employees working for their company. 
							Those individuals working for Marshalls range in skills, talent and experience as they have a mix of employees from landscape, technical, BIM management and so on.</p>
							<p class="gr">In addition to this, one motto or belief Marshalls team stick by is ‘Creating A Better Space’, they believe in order for us to achieve a happier and healthier community we need to take care of our environment and by doing so, it helps them produce better products for the landscape. 
							This is very important because they don’t want their clients to be using manufactures or companies that are only going to provide them with short time solutions, but instead lifelong results. 
							By having this type of system in place is essential as not only does it save clients money in the long run but also it shows they are taking care of the environment.</p>
