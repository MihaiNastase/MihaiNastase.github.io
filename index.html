							<h2>The Idea:</h2>
							<p class="gr">Our proposed design will be in collaboration with STEAM House Projects and Birmingham City University’s ADM department; 
							assisting their integrated roof garden with technological elements. As a starting point, we chose to sketch our desing around the arhitecture of the
							terrace gardens located in the Birmingham City Library.
							By utilising such a landmark as starting point for our design, we will set a precedent in sustainable and technological design. </p>
							<p class="gr">For our prototype design, we will make use of 3D printing technology in order to create a casing that will incorporate the required hardware. 
							We will also make use of  Arduino hardware and its proprietary IDE software. 
							In combination, use of data bases and web software can ensure that the data accumulated by our sensors will be effectively displayed.</p>

							<h2>Company goals</h2>
							<p class="gr">For the following 12 months, we are preparing to showcase our innovative solutions to improve sustainability. 
							We will demonstrate a prototype product at the ‘Innovation Fest’ within Birmingham City University (BCU), to show how technology can aid global sustainability. 
							Once accomplished, we will proceed to work out the means and development of our final product.</p>
							<h2>Our Customers</h2>
							<p class="gr">Our target customers are business clients seeking sustainable solutions to improve global sustainability within their business operations. 
							Therefore, we define a profile that explicitly warrants their need for a technological approach to add sustainable solutions. <br>
							Adding to this definition, we will seek businesses that operate in areas beneficial to community, health, construction and architecture. 
							Ensuring interest’s align with our aim of expanding sustainable goals to improve humankind. </p>
							<p class="gr">Currently, we are collaborating with Marshall's Design (MD), as they have shown interest in our final product. 
							As discussed, ‘our final product; a modular pylon with interchangeable sensors, will gather surrounding environmental data. 
							Displaying such data will aid in raising awareness of how to tackle global sustainability.’ 
							With this in mind, they see a use for our product that will aid their operations. 
							We are excited for this opportunity, where we will be able to develop our product alongside them.</p>
							<p class="gr">Our initial product is targeted for the architecture/construction market, through collaboration with companies in said industry. 
							Such as MD, their support will aid the start-up of our business whilst growing their business through our innovative solutions. In the future, we hope to improving sustainability in the market and thus, industry too.</p>
							<p class="gr">Currently, our collaboration with MD is positive as they have shown interest in our final product. As discussed, ‘our final product; a modular pylon with interchangeable sensors, will gather surrounding environmental data. 
							Displaying such data will aid in raising awareness of how to tackle global sustainability.’ With this in mind, MD see an intended use for our product that will aid their operations. 
							We are excited for this opportunity, where we will be able to develop our product alongside them.</p>
							<p class="gr">We hope future projects will emerge from our own, drawing inspiration and the underlying importance of sustainability that our society must engage with.</p>
